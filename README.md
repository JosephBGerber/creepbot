# creepbot
You probably know what creepbot is already. Creepbot's goal to turn #creepshot into a game with proper scoring and winners. Currently I've implemented a system that will store creepshots and other relevant data and serve it back through player scores using slash commands. Creepbot is a flask server that runs on openshift and it uses mongodb for storage.
