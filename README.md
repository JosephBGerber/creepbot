# snapbot
Snapbot's goal to turn #creepshot into a game with proper scoring and winners. Currently I've implemented a system that will store shots and other relevant data and serve it back through player scores using slash commands. Snapbot is a flask server that runs on openshift and it uses mongodb for storage.
